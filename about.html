                        <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                        <p>
                            I'm Hasan Ibn Ahmed, a Biochemistry undergraduate
                            driven by curiosity, discipline, and a passion for
                            understanding how the world works on a molecular level.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My long-term goal is to become a Physician Assistant
                            so I can work directly with patients and make a real,
                            meaningful impact in healthcare.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="card floating">
                        <h3>My Academic Focus</h3>
                        <p>
                            I’m building a strong foundation in chemistry,
                            biology, physiology, and clinical sciences. I love
                            connecting concepts logically and explaining them
                            clearly to others — teaching is something I naturally
                            enjoy.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="card floating">
                        <h3>My Vision</h3>
                        <p>
                            My goal is to combine scientific knowledge with
                            hands-on clinical experience to help people and give
                            back to my community. I strive to continue growing,
                            learning, and becoming someone who benefits others
                            through knowledge and service.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Outside Academics</h3>
                        <p>
                            I enjoy studying Islam, building real-world skills,
                            leveling up my professional abilities, and constantly
                            improving myself mentally, physically, and spiritually.
